#Stairwell Carollers
The Stairwell Carollers are an a cappella Ottawa choir, formed in 1977 by their director [Pierre Massie](director), a music graduate of the University of Ottawa. The choral group has earned the distinction of being ranked amongst the best of Ottawa choirs by local choral critics. Their repertoire encompasses sacred and secular songs from all eras.

In the rush of the hectic Yuletide season, the Carollers bring focus to the true meaning of Christmas, with their beautiful and unique interpretations of traditional Christmas carols in many languages.

The release of their first CD *Qui creavit celum*, celebrated the Stairwell Carollers' 20th anniversary in 1997.

In 2000 they released *I Saw a Swete Semly Syght* and in 2003 *Mourning Dove*. Their very first madrigal CD, *Audite nova*, was released in October of 2006 and their fourth Xmas CD *Laudemus cum armonia* in 2009.

2012 marked the release of their first CD of sacred songs from the Renaissance, *Cantate Domino*,
Just released is their fifth CD of Xmas carols *O magnum mysterium* which is now available for purchase.

A non-profit organization, they assist in raising funds for local charities through concerts and CD sales.
