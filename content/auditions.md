# Auditions

The Stairwell Carollers hold auditions regularly.

We are presently looking for Sopranos, Tenors and Basses for Fall 2016.

To qualify, all you need is a solid voice, a good ear and a great attitude. 
Reading music is an asset but not a necessity.

Auditions will take place mid to late August. For more info, [send us an email](mailto:info@stairwellcarollers.com).
