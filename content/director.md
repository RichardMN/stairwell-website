# Director #

Pierre (Pete) Massie founded the “Stairwell Carollers” in 1977 and has had the honour and privilege of directing the group ever since.

Hailing from Timmins Ontario, Pierre has made Ottawa his home since 1984. Under the expert guidance of his voice teacher, Gloria Richard, he received his Bachelor of Music and his Bachelor of Education in 1980, achieving a Grade 6 Conservatory equivalence on all brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments, as well as violin.

Several music awards are to his credit, including First Place for his original composition “I Saw a Swete Semly Syght” in the Toronto Amadeus Choir’s International Christmas Song Competition. His lovely carol premiered Dec. 5, 1999 at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in Toronto and was broadcast nationally on CBC radio on Christmas day. Again in 2007, Pierre took first place in the same competition for “Eya, eya, gaudeamus”. The piece was performed in Toronto by the Amadeus Choir on Friday, December 14, at the Yorkminster Park Baptist Church.

Pierre co-authored one of the few French music theory manuals in publication, commissioned by the Ministry of Education and, for two years, he was Director of the Osgoode Arts Council.

A music teacher in the Ottawa/Carleton School Board since 1987, Pierre is currently Head of Fine Arts at Glebe Collegiate High School. He received the OCDSB (Ottawa-Carleton District School Board) Arts Recognition Award for Secondary Integrated Arts for 2010-2011 .
